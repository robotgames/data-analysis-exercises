# Dates, Times, and Time Series

This section contains exercises about wrangling date/time data using the `lubridate` package in the `tidyverse`.  The `lubridate` package is not considered a core part of the `tidyverse` and is not loaded with `library(tidyverse)`.  For the exercises in this section, you will need to load both the `tidyverse` and `lubridate`.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```
